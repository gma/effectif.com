README
======

This repository contains the Nesta project that is running on 
http://effectif.com. Feel free to have a dig around to get a feel for
how to run Nesta.

If you fancy making your own site like this, please don't for this one.
You'd be better off installing the nesta gem and creating your own
project from scratch:

    $ gem install nesta
    $ nesta new mydomain.com
    $ cd mydomain.com
    $ git init

See the Nesta docs for more information: http://effectif.com/nesta
